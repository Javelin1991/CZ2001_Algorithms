# CZ2001 : Algorithms

## Learning Outcome
I have learnt **Algorithm Analysis** in terms of **time and space complexity** and mastered basic algorithms such as **Sorting** and complex algorithms such as **Greedy algorithms** and so. The coursework includes group assignments where our group has implemented various algorithms learnt during the course and used them for relevant applications. 

## Coursework Group Project

- Implemented java code for ``linear probing`` and ``double hashing`` and its applications.
- Implemented java code for ``Integration of merge sort and insertion sort`` and the aim is to be able to sort more efficiently for smaller sub-arrays
- Implemented java code for Application of ``Breadth-first search`` to flight scheduling 

Refer to the respective uploaded folders uploaded for more details.

**Disclaimer : The Java code used to implement the coursework project is no longer maintained. There may be errors or bugs that did not exist at the time of creation.**
